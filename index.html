        <p data-aos="fade-zoom-in" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-offset="0">Cashblack is a platform that rewards members with cashback when they shop online with Black-owned businesses. Users register with us, browse for products and services from Black-owned retailers, and when they make a purchase, they receive cashback from the affiliate commissions we receive. They can withdraw the cashback for themselves or donate it to one of our affiliated goodwill causes where we match the donations.</p>

        <p data-aos="fade-zoom-in" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-offset="0">Founded in 2020, the need for financial and socio-economic empowerment within the Black community was never more apparent - both globally and in the United Kingdom. Cashblack aims to benefit both the Black community and society as a whole by decreasing the racial wealth gap through the promotion of Black-owned businesses and the provision of funds back to consumers of these businesses through cashback.</p>

                <p data-aos="fade-zoom-in" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-offset="0">Supporting Black-owned businesses has the potential to change the perception of Black people in professional settings, which can lead to more opportunities for both board seats and executive roles at major organizations. Additionally, the 27% of the Black population in the UK that had only thought about starting a business without pursuing it any further would be encouraged with more trailblazers in their demographic to inspire them.</p>
                <p data-aos="fade-zoom-in" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine" data-aos-delay="100" data-aos-offset="0">Although it may not be feasible to stop racial profiling and potential harassment from law enforcement by business support alone, the support of Black-owned businesses can provide legitimate opportunities for start-up founders who may have otherwise used their entrepreneurial acumen on illegal enterprising activities.</p>
